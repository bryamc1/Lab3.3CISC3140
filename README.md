# Lab3.3CISC3140

-Intended Use and Process

    -My word counter is intended to work properly as long as the user follows usual grammar rules, like the ones in Word. 
    -The program will take in user input from the text area and put it into a variable. Then the variable will be split by spaces,
    separating word by word. 
    -It will determine whether something is a word if it contains letters, numbers and regularly used punctuation symbols. 
    -The counter won't check if something is properly spelled or whether it's an actual word. Grammar will be entirely on the user. 
    -Putting any other symbol next to a word that is not a period, exclamation, question mark or comma will result in a word not being counted
      -Example: "Hello#" WILL NOT be counted as a word
                "Hello?" WILL BE counted as word
